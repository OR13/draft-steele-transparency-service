This document describes an HTTP and COSE based service with similar properties to CT, KT and SCITT.

## Relation to Certificate Transparency

[RFC9162](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9162/) describes the Certificate Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Transport Layer Security (TLS) server certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves.

## Relation to Key Transparency Architecture

[Key Transparency Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-keytrans-architecture/) defines the terminology and interaction patterns involved in the deployment of Key Transparency (KT) in a general secure group messaging infrastructure, and specifies the security properties that the protocol provides.

## Relation to SCITT Architecture

The [SCITT Architecture](https://github.com/ietf-wg-scitt/draft-ietf-scitt-architecture) describes an approach to developing transparency services focused on securing digital supply chains.
